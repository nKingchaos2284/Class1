# Growth Mindset #

### Class 1 Notes ###

In my own words the Growth mindset is the ability to look at learning as accomplishing a goal. Embracing the suxk, not giving up when you hit a wall but to 
Adapdt improvise and overcome. use whateve means and tools at your disposal to achieve your mission. You have to be flexible and learn from your errors and 
assess and ana;yze the downfall. to me, how I keep a _growth mentality_ is by practicing a few things.

  1. Practice stoicism

  2. learn from my mistakes

  3. **try to predict what could go wrong and what will go wrong and try to plan accordingly**
 
      - _*I am awesome*_

      - If anything goes wrong, I'll be fine

      - ***I AM UNBREAKABLE***
