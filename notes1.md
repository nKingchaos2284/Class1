# Growth Mindset #

### Class 1 Notes ###

In my own words the Growth mindset is the ability to look at learning as accomplishing a goal. Embracing the suxk, not giving up when you hit a wall but to 
Adapdt improvise and overcome. use whateve means and tools at your disposal to achieve your mission. You have to be flexible and learn from your errors and 
assess and ana;yze the downfall. to me, how I keep a _growth mentality_ is by practicing a few things.

  1. Practice stoicism

  2. learn from my mistakes

  3. **try to predict what could go wrong and what will go wrong and try to plan accordingly**
 
      - _*I am awesome*_

      - If anything goes wrong, I'll be fine

      - ***I AM UNBREAKABLE***

1. Challenges
Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, and have worked with it in almost every role I’ve had (including my current gig as a developer on Jira Software), and yet I still find it hard to get my head around.

When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. I throw my hands up in surrender and stop. In other words, I’m in a fixed mindset and avoiding the problem by giving up.

So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head. I jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough (and rather miraculously), I begin to find root causes of the problem.
