Code 301 - Class 14

When women stopped coding
What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? Personal computers for entertainment starting being marketed to the general public, primarily to young men and boys.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? Because they already had exposure to computer science concepts before they got to classes in college.

Diversity

When are diversity efforts most successful? When the case for diversity is made in the context of improving business performance.

Why do diverse companies perform better? More ideas at the table, teams are more creative, the team is more representative of the public and thus more attuned to the demand for different products and services.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
