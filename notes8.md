# Loops. Loops. and more Loops

  Loops are code to script the as the title says, makes things happen repteadly or in a "llop" *gasps*
  i.e. They repeat an action some number of times, offering a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
  
  ## Here's an example
      a "for" loop

    for (initialization; condition; final expression) {
      // code to be executed
    }
    In the syntax above there are three expressions inside the for statement: the initialization, the condition, and the final expression, also known as incrementation.

    Letâ€™s use a basic example to demonstrate what each of these statements does.

    forExample.js
    // Initialize a for statement with 5 iterations
    for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
      // Print each iteration to the console
      console.log(i);
    }
