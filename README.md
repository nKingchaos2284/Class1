To me having a growth mindset is admiting to your self that "you know nothing." Always having the thirst for knowledge. Adapt, improvise, overcome. 

Somethings I like to do

**Practice stoicism

 -learn from my mistakes

 -try to predict what could go wrong and what will go wrong and try to plan accordingly

 **I am awesome

 **If anything goes wrong, I'll be fine

 **_I AM UNBREAKABLE
