Debugging CSS

Sometimes when writing CSS you will encounter an issue where your CSS doesn't seem to be doing what you expect. Perhaps you believe that a certain selector should match an element, but nothing happens, or a box is a different size than you expected. This article will give you guidance on how to go about debugging a CSS problem, and show you how the DevTools included in all modern browsers can help you to find out what is going on.

Prerequisites:	Basic computer literacy, basic software installed, basic knowledge of working with files, HTML basics (study Introduction to HTML), and an idea of how CSS works (study CSS first steps.)
Objective:	To learn the basics of what browser DevTools are, and how to do simple inspection and editing of CSS.
How to access browser DevTools
The article What are browser developer tools is an up-to-date guide explaining how to access the tools in various browsers and platforms. While you may choose to mostly develop in a particular browser, and therefore will become most familiar with the tools included in that browser, it is worth knowing how to access them in other browsers. This will help if you are seeing different rendering between multiple browsers.

You will also find that browsers have chosen to focus on different areas when creating their DevTools. For example, in Firefox there are some excellent tools for working visually with CSS Layout, allowing you to inspect and edit Grid Layouts, Flexbox, and Shapes. However, all of the different browsers have similar fundamental tools, e.g., for inspecting the properties and values applied to elements on your page, and making changes to them from the editor.

In this lesson we will look at some useful features of the Firefox DevTools for working with CSS. In order to do so I'll be using an example file. Load this up in a new tab if you want to follow along, and open up your DevTools as described in the article linked above.
