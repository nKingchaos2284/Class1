# Choosing Text Editor #

### the right one for a programing gig ###

  **The main tool of the web developer** 
  
  #### Is a piece of software that allows you to write code for a website ####
  
   1. There a few things you need for a good text editor
      * code completion 
      * *syntax highlighting* 
      * a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue, the colors) 
      * the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
    
   2. The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs
      * An IDE is an *Integrated Development Environment*
      * Text Editor is what it sounds like
      * IDEs have debug sofware and others program amongst the text editor
  
  3. _*Ultimately...the best one Is the one you like the most*_ FACTS!
  4. I really like VS Code.....
  Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.
It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux
computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code
completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following in the
web developing community
