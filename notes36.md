- How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
TDriver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
