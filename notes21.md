1. What is an HTML attribute?
An HTML attribute is something that adds an extra function to an element in HTML....
"An HTML attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element. For example, attributes can be used to change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements.

Attributes are used by including them in an opening HTML tag:

<tag_name attribute_name="value">Content</tag_name>
An attribute includes the attribute name followed by an equals sign (=) and a value wrapped in quotes. Note that values are often declared by using a value name and value. For example, the style attribute can be used to change the font-size value name to the value of 40px:

<tag_name style="font-size:40px">This text content will be sized to 40 pixels by the web browser.</tag_name>" - 

2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
Anatomy of an HTML element 
Paragraph element including opening tag, content reading 'my cat is very grumpy', and a closing tag
The main parts of our element are as follows:

*The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
*The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
*The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
*The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
