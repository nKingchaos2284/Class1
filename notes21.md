"An HTML attribute is a piece of markup language used to adjust the behavior or display of an HTML element. For example, attributes can be used to change the color, size, or functionality of HTML elements.

"<tag_name attribute_name="value">Content</tag_name>
An attribute includes the attribute name followed by an equals sign (=) and a value wrapped in quotes. Note that values are often declared by using a value name and value. For example, the style attribute can be used to change the font-size value name to the value of 40px:

<tag_name style="font-size:40px">This text content will be sized to 40 pixels by the web browser.</tag_name>" -
