## Class 11 Notes

Audio/Video

The <video> element
The <video> element allows you to embed a video very easily. A really simple example looks like this:

<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
  <p>
    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a
    <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.
  </p>
</video>
Copy to Clipboard
The features of note are:

src
In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

controls
Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

The paragraph inside the <video> tags
This is called fallback content â€” this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case, we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.
